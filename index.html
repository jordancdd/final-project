                <p>"'The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes' delivers a mesmerizing look into the life of Coriolanus Snow and the root causes of his villainous behavior. Collins once again proves that she is a master of building a fascinating world around complex characters who must grapple with the complications of chaos and control and their effects on human nature."
                    --The Associated Press
                    
                    "It's the pull between Coryo's head and heart — and the realization that he actually has a beating heart, not just a rose-scented lump of coal — that makes the future President Snow very worthy of a 517-page prequel."
                    --The Washington Post
                    
                    "Both a tense, character-driven piece and a cautionary tale...The twists and heartbreaks captivate despite tragic inevitabilities."
                    --Kirkus Reviews
                    
                    "If you read The Hunger Games in one sitting, settle in for the long haul once more—because The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is nearly impossible to put down...The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is incredibly exciting, thought-provoking, and relevant."
                    --Amazon Book Review
                    
                    "A sleek Hunger Games prequel...The plot of the novel rests on deception and pretence, its view of humanity bleak; yet Collins's themes of friendship, betrayal, authority and oppression, as well as the extra layers of lore about mockingjays and Capitol's history, will please and thrill."
                    --The Guardian
                    
                    "A gripping mix of whipsaw plot twists and propulsive writing make this story's complex issues—vulnerability and abuse, personal responsibility, and institutionalized power dynamics—vivid and personal."
                    --Publishers Weekly
                    
                    "Fans will appreciate revisiting the world of Panem, and teens may relate to Coriolanus beginning to grapple with big ideas like human nature and whether people on opposite sides of a war are fundamentally different."
                    --School Library Journal
                    
                    "A Hunger Games without Everdeen might have seemed as peculiar as a Potter without Harry, but it works beautifully, largely thanks to a new character. The clever, charismatic precursor, Lucy Baird Gray, a Covey (a sort of gypsy) who is chosen to represent District 12 in the tenth Games. She is a folk singer of prophetic ballads and has a thing about snakes. She is gorgeous, of course, in her late mother's old rainbow dress (the casting for the film, confirmed by Lionsgate, will be fun)."
